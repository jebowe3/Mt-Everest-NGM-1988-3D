# Mt Everest, National Geographic, 1988, 3D
3D mapping of very high elevation terrain using MapLibre GL JS

I encountered a lot of difficulties generating RGB tif files from DEMs of terrain with extreme ranges of elevations, so I wanted to document how I was able to overcome this using a scan one of my favorite wall maps - a 1988 National Geographic Magazine shaded topographic map insert of Mt. Everest.
